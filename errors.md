## Introduction

When you start a new Lumen project, error and exception handling is already configured for you. In addition, Lumen is integrated with the [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) logging library, which provides support for a variety of powerful log handlers.

For more information on logging, please consult the full Laravel [documentation on logging](https://laravel.com/docs/logging).
